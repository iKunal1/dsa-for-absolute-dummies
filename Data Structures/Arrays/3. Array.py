- EXPLANATIONS:
    - An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. 
      It provides a way to store and access a group of related values using a single variable name.
      
    - Each element in an array is identified by an index, which represents its position in the array. 
      The index starts at 0 for the first element, and increases by 1 for each subsequent element. 
      This means that if an array has n elements, the indices range from 0 to n-1.
      
    - Arrays can be used to store and manipulate different types of data, such as numbers, characters, strings, and objects. 
      They are commonly used in programming for a variety of tasks, such as sorting, searching, and processing large amounts of data.
      
-  MOST COMMONLY USED BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS:

    - array.append(x) - This function is used to add an element x to the end of the array.
    - array.extend(iterable) - This function is used to add the elements of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) to the end of the array.
    - array.insert(i, x) - This function is used to insert an element x at a specific index i in the array.
    - array.remove(x) - This function is used to remove the first occurrence of element x from the array.
    - array.pop(i) - This function is used to remove and return the element at a specific index i in the array. If no index is specified, the last element of the array is removed and returned.
    - array.index(x) - This function is used to find the first occurrence of element x in the array and return its index.
    - array.count(x) - This function is used to count the number of occurrences of element x in the array.
    - array.sort() - This function is used to sort the elements of the array in ascending order.
    - array.reverse() - This function is used to reverse the order of the elements in the array.
    - len(array) - This function is used to return the number of elements in the array.
