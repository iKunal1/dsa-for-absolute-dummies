- EXPLANATION:
    - In Python, there is no built-in class named HashSet. 
      However, Python provides a built-in class called set, which can be used to achieve similar functionality to a hash set. 
      The set class in Python represents an unordered collection of unique elements. 
      It is implemented using a hash table data structure, which allows for efficient membership testing, insertion, and deletion operations.
