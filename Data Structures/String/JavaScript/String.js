/*
- EXPLANATION:

    - In JavaScript, a string is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. 
      It is used to store and manipulate textual data such as names, messages, and other pieces of information.
      A string in JavaScript is created by enclosing the characters within single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or backticks (``).

    - Strings are immutable in JavaScript, which means once a string is created, it cannot be changed. 
      However, you can perform various operations on strings to extract information or manipulate them in different ways.


SOME COMMON STRING OPERATIONS IN JAVASCRIPT:
    - Accessing characters: You can access individual characters in a string using square brackets and the index of the character (indexes start at 0).
    - Concatenation: You can concatenate (join) two or more strings together using the + operator or the concat() method.
    - String length: You can find the length of a string (number of characters) using the length property.
    - String methods: JavaScript provides several built-in methods for working with strings. 
      Some commonly used methods include toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), slice(), substring(), indexOf(), replace(), and split().
