- EXPLANATION:
    - The prefix sum algorithm, also known as the cumulative sum algorithm, 
      is a simple and efficient algorithm that calculates the cumulative sum of an array. 
      This algorithm is often used in computer science to preprocess an array in order to answer range queries in constant time.
