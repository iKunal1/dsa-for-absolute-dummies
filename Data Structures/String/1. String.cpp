/*
- String is a sequence of characters stored in contiguous memory locations. 
  It is represented by the std::string class, which is a part of the standard library.
  Strings can be manipulated in a variety of ways using built-in string functions, such as length(), substr(), find(), and replace(). 
  There are also operators that can be used with strings, such as the + operator, which concatenates two strings.
