/*
- EXPLANATION:

    - A HashSet is a data structure that represents a collection of unique elements, where each element appears only once in the collection. 
      It is designed to efficiently store and manage a set of distinct values without allowing duplicates. 
      HashSets typically provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, 
      making them useful for scenarios where you need to quickly determine the presence of an element or 
      ensure that no duplicates exist within the collection.
