- EXPLANATION:

    - Sliding window algorithm is a commonly used technique in computer science that is used to solve a variety of problems 
      related to arrays, strings, and other data structures. It involves creating a window of fixed size 
      and sliding it over an array or string to perform some computation.
      
    - The size of the window and the number of elements it moves at each step can be adjusted to suit the needs 
      of the specific problem being solved. The technique is commonly used in algorithms that involve 
      finding the maximum/minimum value in a set of data, or counting the number of occurrences of a specific element.
