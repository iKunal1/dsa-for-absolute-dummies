/*
- EXPLANATIONS:
    - An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. 
      It provides a way to store and access a group of related values using a single variable name.
      
    - Each element in an array is identified by an index, which represents its position in the array. 
      The index starts at 0 for the first element, and increases by 1 for each subsequent element. 
      This means that if an array has n elements, the indices range from 0 to n-1.
      
    - Arrays can be used to store and manipulate different types of data, such as numbers, characters, strings, and objects. 
      They are commonly used in programming for a variety of tasks, such as sorting, searching, and processing large amounts of data.
