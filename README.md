## DSA for Absolute Dummiesüòµ‚Äçüí´

- This is a super simplified examples of the common data structures and algorithms written in easy to read C++ (for now), Python and JS (later I'll add it).
- Reading through this will help you learn about what data structures and algorithms, how to use them etc.

## Why should I care to do this? 
- Lack of good courses and good books.
- It's simpler for me, I like to learn about this stuff and every day working on this, I am learning too. 
- Because I need it to refresh my memory if I am stuck on something or whatever.. 
- You can user it to refresh your memory too or to learn something new, but easy way (it's hard but it will get easier in time).

## But data structures and algorithms are so hard!
- Yes. Life is hard. I have just one question on that. Do you remember that first day you enter this field of programming and IT in general? 
  I remember that I've struggled for 7 days about basic functions (objects) and functionality behind them? Funny? 
  That's all I am gonna say. 

## Where to begin?
- You can simply start over here wherever you want. Try to go through some Data Structures first.
- Then, you can go through google and find some easy exercises or websites with coding problems like Codewars or LeetCode.
- Or you can go buy some book or course and use this if you are stuck on something or you don't understand some stuff.
