- EXPLANATION:

    - Brute Force algorithm is a straightforward approach to solve a problem by trying all possible solutions and selecting the best one. 
      This method is usually used when the input size is relatively small and has a limited number of possibilities. 
      Brute Force algorithm is also known as Exhaustive Search algorithm, as it exhausts all possible solutions to find the optimal solution.
