/*
- EXPLANATION:

    - In JavaScript, a string is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. 
      It is used to store and manipulate textual data such as names, messages, and other pieces of information.
      A string in JavaScript is created by enclosing the characters within single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or backticks (``).

    - Strings are immutable in JavaScript, which means once a string is created, it cannot be changed. 
      However, you can perform various operations on strings to extract information or manipulate them in different ways.
