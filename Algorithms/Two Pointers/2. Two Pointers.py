- EXPLANATION:
    - Certainly, the Two Pointers algorithm is a technique commonly used in array/string problems where you have to find a subsequence 
      or a subset that satisfies a certain condition. It is called "Two Pointers" because the algorithm uses two pointers that move 
      through the array in different directions to find the solution.
