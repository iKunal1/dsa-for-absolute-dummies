- EXPLANATION:
    - The Binary Search Algorithm is an efficient way to search for a specific value within a sorted list of values. 
      It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half and checking whether the target value is in the lower or upper half. 
      This process is repeated until the target value is found, or until it is determined that the target value is not in the list.
