- EXPLANATION:
    - A palindrome is a string or number that reads the same backward as forward. 
      For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because it reads the same way forward and backward.

    - There are multiple ways to check if a string is a palindrome or not.
    

- TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    - The time complexity of the Palindrome algorithm is O(n/2), which simplifies to O(n), where n is the length of the input string. 
      This is because the algorithm only needs to compare the first half of the string with the second half, which takes n/2 comparisons.

    - The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n), as the entire input string is stored in memory.
